# Cherry Leaves Mildew Detection

Farmy & Foods' is a company in agricultural sector. Companies finest product is cherry plantations and the company is concerned about supplying the market with a product of compromised quality. 

Currently, the process is to manually verify if a given cherry tree contains powdery mildew. This method is both costly and consumes a huge amount of time. 

This project aims to create a dashboard app that plots differences between healthy and mildew-containing cherry leaves as well as develop a ML model that can predict whether a given image is a healthy cherry leaf or contains powdery mildew.

## Planning 

### Business Requirements

The IT team of Farmy & Foods have suggested an ML system that detects instantly, using a leaf tree image, if it is healthy or has powdery mildew. If successful, this could be extended to detecting pests for other crops.
The dataset is a collection of healthy and powdery mildew-containing cherry leaves provided by the company.
- 1 - The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a healthy cherry leaf from one with powdery mildew.
- 2 - The client is interested in predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.

### Hypothesis and how to validate?
